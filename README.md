# Enhancements and Critique of Flip-Flop Neurons

A project that discusses enhancements and critique of Flip-Flop neurons suggested in "The flip-flop neuron: a memory efficient alternative for solving challenging sequence processing and decision-making problems" [(Kumari et al., 2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-023-08552-7#:~:text=04%20May%202023-,The%20flip%2Dflop%20neuron%3A%20a%20memory%20efficient%20alternative%20for%20solving,processing%20and%20decision%2Dmaking%20problems). 

## Project Proposal

The project aims to contribute through a comprehensive literature review, ablation studies, integration of conventional ML techniques, performance benchmarking across various tasks, and comparative analysis with novel ML methods to evaluate the flip-flop neuron model's efficacy. A detailed doc can be found [here](./documents/Project-Proposal.pdf).
